## Data Flow

1. Service YAML → ServiceOrchestrator (facade) → ResourceDetector (indexes by kind) → OrchestratorContext
2. ExecutionEngine iterates over registered ResourceHandlers (SLO, Alert, Dashboard, etc.)
3. Each handler's generate() method creates resources, returns count
4. Dashboard generation: IntentTemplate.get_panel_specs() → MetricResolver.resolve() → Panel objects
5. Metric resolution: Custom overrides → Discovery → Fallback chain → Guidance
6. Resource creation: Async providers apply changes (Grafana, PagerDuty, etc.)
7. Deployment webhooks: Provider parses webhook → DeploymentEvent → DeploymentRecorder → Database
8. Drift analysis: DriftAnalyzer queries Prometheus for trend analysis → severity assessment
9. Policy evaluation: PolicyEvaluator checks conditions → PolicyAuditRecorder logs → API returns override option
10. Topology export: DependencyGraph → build_topology() → TopologyGraph → serialize_json/mermaid/dot()

## Architectural Invariants

These are hard rules — violations are bugs, not style issues.

1. Dashboard generation must use `IntentBasedTemplate` subclasses and `grafana-foundation-sdk` — no raw JSON dashboard construction
2. Metric resolution must go through the resolver (`dashboards/resolver.py`) — do not hardcode metric names in templates
3. All PromQL must use `service="$service"` label selector (not `cluster` or other labels)
4. `histogram_quantile` must include `sum by (le)` — bare `rate()` inside `histogram_quantile` is always a bug
5. Rate queries must aggregate: `sum(rate(metric{service="$service"}[5m]))`
6. Status label conventions must match service type: API (`status!~"5.."`), Worker (`status!="failed"`), Stream (`status!="error"`)
7. Error handling must use `NthLayerError` subclasses — bare `Exception` or `RuntimeError` raises are not allowed
8. CLI commands must be thin — business logic lives in modules/classes, not in click command functions
9. CLI output must go through `ux.py` helpers — no raw `print()` or `click.echo()` in command handlers
10. External service integrations must use official SDKs (`grafana-foundation-sdk`, `pagerduty`, `boto3`) — no bespoke HTTP clients
11. Exit codes must follow convention: 0=success, 1=warning/error, 2=critical/blocked

## Service types: resolved vs authored

`nthlayer_common` owns the service-type rule — the six OpenSRM v2 values
plus the `^x-[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$` extension branch. generate does not keep its
own copy; import `resolve_service_type` / `is_valid_service_type` /
`valid_service_types_phrase` from `nthlayer_common.manifest.models`, or from
`specs.manifest`, which re-exports them (opensrm-z3ab).

`ServiceContext` and `ReliabilityManifest` each carry **two** spellings, and
picking the wrong one is a silent bug:

| Field | Value | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `.type` | resolved — aliases applied (`web` → `x-web`) | internal branching, comparisons, emitted labels, serialising a manifest back to a file |
| `.authored_type` | exactly what the author wrote | `${type}` substitution into generated PromQL |

The split exists because `${type}` lands in **label matchers run against the
operator's existing Prometheus**. Rewriting `web` to `x-web` there yields a
matcher selecting zero series: the SLO reads no-data and its burn-rate
alerts never fire, while every generated artifact stays perfectly valid.
Emitted labels and migrated files take the resolved spelling; anything that
queries pre-existing data takes the authored one.

## Known Intentional Patterns

Do not flag these during review or audit:

- Demo app intentionally missing metrics (`redis_db_keys` from notification-worker, `elasticsearch_jvm_memory_*` from search-api) to demonstrate guidance panels
- Legacy template patterns that are tracked as known tech debt in Beads
- Empty catch blocks in migration code are intentional (best-effort migration)
- Lenient validation in `nthlayer validate-metadata` is by design (warns, doesn't fail)

## Release Process

Driven by `release-please` — there are no manual release steps.

- Merging conventional commits to `main` opens or updates a standing
  `chore(main): release X.Y.Z` PR; merging THAT PR tags the release and
  triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` → PyPI (trusted publisher, no
  token).
- **`CHANGELOG.md` and the version are GENERATED. Do not hand-edit either** —
  release-please overwrites them. The version of record is
  `.release-please-manifest.json`.
- `fix:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, `feat!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
  → major. Merge such PRs with a MERGE COMMIT, not a squash: release-please
  reads individual commits, and a squash collapses the footer into the PR
  description where it will not be seen.
